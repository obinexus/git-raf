## 📜 The Governance Trilogy
![docs/spec.pdf](./docs/spec.pdf)

**Who governs the governor?**
**Who has the final say?**
**What if two policies fight?**

> In traditional systems, these questions spark politics.
> In RAF, they're settled in code.

### 🔁 Problem 1: "I Am the Governor!"
![docs/spec.pdf](./docs/spec.pdf)

*"No, I am!" Who decides who gets to decide?*

In legacy dev teams, authority is vibes-based:

* The loudest voice or most senior person gets the last word.
* Rules are soft suggestions.
* Accountability is unclear.

#### 🧠 RAF's Answer: Regulation by Competence
![docs/spec.pdf](./docs/spec.pdf)

* Every dev action is a **cryptographic transaction**.
* Commits are validated via:

    * `aura_seal`
    * `entropy_checksum`
    * `policy_tag`
* You only govern what you've proven you can govern.

> Authority ≠ seniority.
> Authority = verified governance compliance.
> You are trusted because **your code holds under entropy.**
